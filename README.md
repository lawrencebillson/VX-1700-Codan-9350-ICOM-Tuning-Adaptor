# VX-1700-Codan-9350-ICOM-Tuning-Adaptor
Vertex Standard VX-1700 tuning adaptor - works with Codan 9350 autotune and ICOM AT-130 tuner

## What is it?
This is a hardware/software project to interface Vertex Standard VX-1700 commercial radios with some existing antenna tuners I have around the house.

## What's the status?
We're still at proof of concept stage. There's a few things on the TODO list

## What's on the todo list?
The list:
* Measure VX-1700 power output in relation to the applied ALC voltage. We need to tell the radio to reduce power during a tune cycle.
* Measure signalling voltages for the AT-130 - They may require a voltage divider or strong pull-down resistors to be compliant with a 5v micro.
* Same same for my Codan 9350
* Document all of those things!
* Design a circuit
* Layout a board
