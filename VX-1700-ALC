# VX-1700 ALC Voltages
The sensible way to control the output power of the VX-1700 is to apply a negative voltage to the ALC pin on the 'accessory' socket.

This will normally require an isolated DC/DC converter to generate the negative voltage line.

# Test setup
I used the following equipment:
VX-1700 - set to 100W on 14Mhz
RF power meter - (not calibrated, but reads 99-100 with no ALC bias pplied)
Dry dummy load
Bench power supply, set to apply negative voltage to the ALC line

To generate the RF signal, I grounded the "TX REQ" pin on the ACC port.
